It’s built to keep applications online even with large numbers of users and sharp increases in usage. cloud.gov runs on top of industry-provided infrastructure, Amazon Web Services GovCloud. cloud.gov PaaS is open source, based on the Cloud Foundry project with additional open source components.

## 3.0 Requirements

TTS intends to procures professional services in order for the vendor to perform operations and maintenance for the cloud.gov technical system, specifically the Cloud Foundry-based platform and supporting services and web applications.

The primary objectives are:

* Operate, maintain, monitor, and update a Cloud Foundry deployment and the supporting services underlying cloud.gov.

* Provide consultation for the cloud.gov development team to support Cloud Foundry best practices for existing and new capabilities.

* Automate operation processes and increase the resilience of the system.

## 4.0 Evaluation

### 4.1 Basis for Award

TTS will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria set forth below and then make award based on best value using tradeoffs. TTS intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, vendors must successfully pass through each phase.

TTS will award an order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the Request for Quote that represents the best value to the government, price and other criteria specified below. Vendors are advised technical evaluation factors combined are more important than price; as Non-Price ratings become closer, price will become more important.

* Phase 1 –  Technical Response
  * Criteria 1 - **Technical understanding and approach**
  * Criteria 2 - **Relevant experience**
  * Criteria 3 - **Personnel qualifications** 
* Phase 2 - Oral Interview 
* Phase 3 - Price Response


Vendors must meet all requirements in Phase 1 and must be deemed technically acceptable or higher in order to be invited for Phase 2 - Oral Interview. Quotes that have failed to meet the criteria established in Phase 1 will no longer be considered for award. Vendors that pass Phase 2 with a rating of acceptable or higher will be evaluated on their price submission. 

TTS will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. TTS may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate TTS to exercise the option(s). 

**NOTE: TTS anticipates selecting an awardee based upon initial quotes received; therefore, vendors are cautioned to submit their best price and technical quotes in the initial submission.**

### 4.2 Evaluation Criteria 

Quotes will be evaluated on the factors listed below. Failure to follow the instructions may result in the quote being removed from further consideration for award.

Vendors are cautioned not to include assumptions, caveats, or exceptions within any part of their submission. Inclusion of assumptions, caveats, or exceptions to the requirement of any kind may result in the quote no longer being considered. Vendors should ONLY submit information explicitly requested in this RFQ.

#### 4.2.1 Phase 1 –  Technical Response

As vendors respond to each criteria below, vendors are required to provide how they will meet the objective and tasks identified in the [Performance Work Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHns3nU58Tx_MN55HCJdifNcjOv9MlFotNzwqVvGBQU/edit#heading=h.xmkg46x4ggop). TODO fix link

##### Criteria 1 - Technical understanding and approach (limit to 3 pages)

Vendors are expected to answer each of the below questions. Vendors should be as detailed and concise as possible. Responses to these questions will be evaluated based on strengths, weaknesses, and risks to the government and assigned an overall rating.   

* How would you recommend that a Cloud Foundry deployment manage and rotate secrets? For example, what tools and techniques would you use?
* How would you handle backup and restore of a Cloud Foundry deployment?
* How would you provide a user interface for end-users working with a managed service? For example, you want to provide a database service from an IaaS, and allow your users to control attributes of the database (such as the size of database) or view logs.
* How would you apply Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry together to better enable platform operators or customers?

##### Criteria 2 - Relevant experience (limit to 3 pages)

This criteria considers the extent of the required experience that the vendor has to perform the work. TTS will evaluate summaries of vendor’s project(s), including specific technical details (inclusive of whom your customer was/is, project title(s), and dates). In order to be considered relevant, the vendor must answer each question and discuss its experience in the following:

###### A. Explicit Cloud Foundry operations experience (distinguishing PCF from OSS)
  * Not user/developer persona, but platform operator
  * Not simply compliance, but actual engineering work \
  \
*Note: TTS is not looking for general experience with cloud technologies or services - TTS is specifically looking for experience with Cloud Foundry ([https://www.cloudfoundry.org/](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/)).* \
\
The vendor should submit a narrative summation discussing the vendor’s experience in Cloud Foundry platform operations engineering as the prime contractor or partner. Multiple projects (no more than five examples) can be discussed but must include project title(s) and dates. At a minimum your narrative should address the following:

    * Cloud Foundry platform operations engineering, including specific brief summaries of the projects you’ve completed. 

    * TTS would like to hear about any experience with open source Cloud Foundry, although experience with Pivotal Cloud Foundry or other deployments of Cloud Foundry is helpful as well. 

    * Your firm’s experience automating Cloud Foundry deployments and updates. 

###### B. Describe any past experience operating Cloud Foundry in a regulated or compliance-heavy environment, such as under FISMA, DISA, or HIPAA, including project title(s) and dates.

   * How did that environment influence the way that you operate CF? 

###### C. Provide an example (redaction of identifying details is ok) of a specific improvement you made to a component in the CF stack, tool in the CF ecosystem, or internal functions in a CF deployment within an organization/company, including project title(s) and dates.

* We would like to hear about code you’ve written. Examples: if you’ve done open source work, you could provide a pull request to a component, or a link to a repository with a tool. If your work is not open source, briefly describe the technical problem you solved and how you solved it. For example, our cloud.gov team made a BOSH release for an open source security tool, Sysdig Falco ([https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/falco-boshrelease](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/falco-boshrelease)), because the CF community did not already provide a tool for behavioral monitoring for containers.

##### Criteria 3 - Personnel qualifications (each resume limited to 1 page)

TTS will evaluate the qualifications of the proposed personnel. The vendor shall submit names, titles, and resumes of the proposed personnel. Limit the resumes to the relevant experience and qualifications only. The proposed personnel shall possess the combination of knowledge, specialized skills and abilities to assist TTS in achieving cloud.gov’s goals and objectives and in meeting its federal regulatory and policy requirements. 

Continuity, technical expertise, and institutional knowledge are important for the success of this requirement. The existing cloud.gov team applies the following skills in day-to-day development, operations, and continuous monitoring of the cloud.gov system. To perform all requirements the vendor should provide qualified personnel who also possess these skills (based in their professional and personal experience) so they will supplement our capacity to operate and improve the system.

For each personnel:

* 3+ years of experience designing and developing business applications or other software

* Experience working in a team environment applying XP methods (such as pairing and test-driven development) and agile practices (such as Scrum or Kanban)

* Strong experience with deployment and operation of Cloud Foundry, with hands-on experience applying related tools including Concourse, BOSH, and Terraform

* Experience using git (and preferably GitHub) to manage code and infrastructure configuration

Between the personnel:

* Experience logging and monitoring distributed systems (using tools such as ELK or Prometheus)

* Ability to work with Golang, Python, and Java code

* Hands-on experience applying containerization tools (such as Docker) and container orchestration tools (such as Kubernetes)

* Experience providing common managed services using the Open Service Broker API (such as Elasticsearch, S3, or RDBMSes)

* Knowledge of best practices and recommendations for cloud governance and cost minimization

* Experience in operating distributed and cloud-native architectures

* Experience operating common AWS services (such as EC2, VPC, S3, ELB, Security Groups, IAM, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail) and preferably other public clouds such as Google Cloud Platform, Azure, OpenStack, etc.

* Operating system administration and security – Ubuntu Linux and preferably also Windows Server

* Experienced with DevOps processes/tools and have an understanding of secure coding, testing, and deployment practices (i.e. DevSecOps)

## 14.0 Contractor Performance Information

(1) Evaluating Contractor Performance: The General Services Administration is using the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) module as the secure, confidential, information management tool to facilitate the performance evaluation process. CPARS enables a comprehensive evaluation by capturing comments from both TTS and the contractor. The website for CPARS is [http://www.cpars.gov](http://www.cpars.gov) Completed CPARS evaluations are sent to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) which may then be used by Federal acquisition community for use in making source selection decisions. PPIRS assists acquisition officials by serving as the single source for contractor past performance data.


(2) CPARS Registration: Each award requiring an evaluation must be registered in CPARS. The awardee will receive several automated emails. Within thirty days of award, the contractor will receive an e-mail that contains user account information, as well as the applicable contract and order number(s) assigned. The contractor will be granted one user account to access all evaluations.


(3) Contractor CPARS Training: The contractor may sign up for CPARS training. A schedule of classes will be posted to the CPARS training site ([http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm](http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm) ) and updated as needed.

(4) Contractor Representative (CR) Role: All evaluations will be sent the contractor Representative (CR) named on your award. The CR will be able to access CPARS to review and comment on the evaluation. If your CR is not already in the CPARS system, the contracting officer will request the name and email address of the person that will be responsible for the CR role on your award.

Once an evaluation is ready to be released the CR will receive an email alerting them the evaluation is ready for their review and comment. The email will indicate the time frame the CR has to respond to the evaluation; however, the CR may return the evaluation earlier than this date.

TTS shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer (i.e., contracting director) to consider any disagreement between TTS and the contractor regarding TTS’s evaluation of the contractor. Based on the review, the individual at a level above the contracting officer will issue the ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation.
Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file.
