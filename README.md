*This is a request for information notice only. This is not a request for an offer or proposals.

## 1.0 Summary of goal
The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Division is conducting a market survey and is seeking qualified large or small business firms (including small disadvantaged businesses such as Certified HUBZone, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, and Women-Owned Small Business, etc.) to provide professional services in support of the cloud.gov platform.

## 2.0 Background about the cloud.gov platform
cloud.gov is a Platform as a Service built specifically for government work. cloud.gov customer teams are responsible for their own application code, while the cloud.gov platform handles the security and maintenance of everything underneath. It’s built to keep applications online even with large numbers of users and sharp increases in usage.

cloud.gov runs on top of industry-provided infrastructure (Amazon Web Services GovCloud is the “Infrastructure as a Service” provider). The platform includes access to this infrastructure while removing the complexity of managing it from the customer experience. The cloud.gov Platform as a Service is open source, based on the Cloud Foundry project with additional open source components.

## 3.0 How we work
cloud.gov uses DevOps practices and Infrastructure as Code principles for operations and maintenance. This work combines system administration and code development. Team members commit all changes to source control (git) and test and deploy them using continuous integration and continuous deployment tools. We work in a collaborative, remote-first environment, including chat and videocall discussions of changes before, during, and after development, with frequent use of pairing between employees and contractors.

## 4.0 Timeline and duration
We anticipate starting the professional services contract as soon as it is awarded, with a Period of Performance until the end of FY19 (October 2019), with an option to continue for FY20 (November 2019 to October 2020).

## 5.0 NAICS codes
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement will be finalized once submissions resulting from this RFI have been analyzed.

We anticipate that NAICS codes may include:
* 54 -- Professional, Scientific and Technical Services
* 541511 -- Custom Computer Programming Services

vendors can suggest a NAICS code as well

## 6.0 Objectives for technical services
